Store Wide Sales
--------------------------

Automatic discounts are how you do store wide sales.

.. warning:: 
	Automatic discounts must always be percentage sales, and you can only have one running at a time. You should also ensure that you do not apply auto discounts to gift certificates.

1. In your site's admin interface, create a new discount.

2. Make an "automatic" discount, so that it is available to the automatic discount template tags. Do not enter a new price in the admin for the products.

3. In the template where you want to show the auto discount, load the ``{% satchmo_discounts %}`` (Visit `Satchmo Templates`_ documentation for details on Satchmo filters) filter library.

4. You can now add some markup to your template, similar to below::

	{% if sale %}
	<div>
		<div class="saleprices">
			<h3> Regular price: <span class="saleprice" id="price">{{product.unit_price|currency}}</span></h3>
	    	<h3> {{ sale.percentage_text }} off: <span class="saleprice" id="sale_saved">{{ product|discount_saved:"sale"|currency }}</span></h3>
	    	<h3> Your price: <span class="saleprice" id="sale_price">{{ product|discount_price:"sale"|currency }}</span></h3>
	{% else %}
		<h3 id="price">{{product.unit_price|currency}}</h3>
	</div>
	{% endif %}
	
The key parts of the above markup are the ``{{ product|discount_saved:"sale"|currency }}`` and the ``{{ product|discount_price:"sale"|currency }}`` filtered variables. The former returns the amount saved by the discount while the latter returns the discounted price, all in the correct locale currency.
