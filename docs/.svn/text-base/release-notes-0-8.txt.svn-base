    - New tiered shipping module
    - New optional app "satchmo.upsell" which allows product upselling on product detail pages
    - New signals in get_qty_price methods of products, allowing code to manipulate the price returned by the function.  Example code using these signals is at satchmo.contrib.cartqty_discounts, which modifies the qty_discount method to calculate the discount based on the total number of items in the cart, rather than the total amount of the lineitem.
